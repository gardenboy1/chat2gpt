# Chat2GPT 
### WIP

Slowly but surely, trying to build a thing where you can use your human voice to speak to GPT and then hear GPT reply back to you with a human voice. (And then continue the dialogue as in a normal conversation, of course.) 

Started a course on Buildspace ([build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer)), hence the extant file names (etc.) from the forked repo.
